## 🔒 Security Features

### Why Can't I Mark Twice?

The system tracks:
1. **Your Device** (IP Address)
2. **Your Browser** (User Agent)
3. **Your Student ID**

If you try again:
- ❌ "You have already marked attendance"
- System prevents duplicate entries
- Protects against proxy attendance

### Why Can't I Mark for My Friend?

The system prevents:
- Same device marking multiple IDs
- Same IP address with different IDs
- Proxy attendance fraud

If detected:
- ❌ "Duplicate attendance attempt detected"
- Both attempts may be flagged
- Instructor will be notified
